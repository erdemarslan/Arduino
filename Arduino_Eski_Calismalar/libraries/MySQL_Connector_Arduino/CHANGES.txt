CHANGES
=======
This file contains a brief summary of changes made from previous versions of
the connector.

1.2.0a - April 2017
---------------------
* Stability and speed improvements.

* Removed infinite wait in read_packet() if connection dropped.
  Merged wait_for_client() and wait_for_data() into one
  universal wait_for_bytes(int).
* Improved connect() speed.
* Improved sending queries speed.
  Sending the whole buffer at a time (not byte by byte).
* Fixed bug with check_ok_packet() return value.
  check_ok_packet() simplified to get_packet_type().
* Added checks for buffer validity in places it is going to be used.
  Improved stability on "incorrect" methods calls.
* Restored WITH_SELECT, but defined by default.
* Added DEBUG define to avoid prints to Serial port.
  Useful when Serial is used to communicate with sensors.
* Added example for ESP8266.

1.1.1a - January 2016
---------------------
* Minor issue with deprecated #import fixed. No new functionality.

1.1.0a - January 2016
---------------------
* Major redesign of classes. Now have separate connection and cursor classes
* Removed WITH_SELECT, WITH_WIFI, etc. to avoid confusion and simplify
* Renamed many methods to correspond with traditional MySQL connector
  nomenclature
* Added more error handling for lossy networks
* Memory deallocation methods consolidated (see examples)
* More, smaller examples added
* Documentation updated

1.0.4ga - July 2015
--------------------
* Fixed a defect in the get_next_row() method.
* Added the reference manual. Yippee!

1.0.3rc - March 2015
--------------------
* Code has been changed slightly to help with long latency issues over
  wifi and slow connections.
* A new cleanup method was added to cleanup a final OK packet after a
  stored procedure call with a result.
* Code now compiles without errors for the latest Beta Arduino IDE
  (const error).

1.0.2b - April 2014
-------------------
* The WITH_SELECT is turned *OFF* by default. If you want to use select
  queries, be sure to uncomment this in the mysql.h file.
* Reduced memory use! The library has been trimmed to save memory.
  - All static strings moved to PROGMEM strings
  - Unused structures removed (e.g. ok_packet)
  - Moved more methods not needed to optional compilation

1.0.1b - February 2014
----------------------
* Added disconnect() method for disconnecting from server.
* Improved error handling for dropped packets.
* Better error handling for lost connections and out of memory detection.

1.0.0b - October 2013
---------------------
* Improved support for result sets (select queries)
* Added conditional compile for use with select queries. If you don't use
  select queries, comment out WITH_SELECT in mysql.h to save some memory.
* Added support for WiFi shield using conditional compilation.
* New version() method to check version of the connector.
* Simplified, single-file download

Initial Release - April 2013
----------------------------
