# `hd44780` Extensible hd44780 LCD library ![hd44780Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.9.0-yellow.svg?style=plastic)

CurrentStatus
=============
The library is currently in an alpha state.

While the API and underlying code is stable and has been tested, there are
possibly some changes in the constructors for the included i/o classes that will
not be backward compatible, particuarly for the `hd44780_I2Cexp` i/o class.

Any potential changes are not anticipated to affect lcd `hd44780_I2Cexp` autoconfiguration object definitions or main line sketch code.

After these potential changes are finalized, the project will move to a beta state
and should quickly move to a 1.0.0 release candidate followed by a
1.0.0 release.

Library Overview
=================
hd44780 is an extensible Arduino LCD library for hd44780 based LCD displays.
The library consists of a hd44780 base class combined with one or more
i/o subclasses to perform the i/o communication between the host and the
hd44780 display interface.

While the library is API compatible with the Arduino IDE bundled LiquidCrystal library, hd44780 is not a direct drop in replacement for the LiquidCrystal library.

The API functionality provided by the hd44780 base class, when combined
with an hd44780 library i/o subclass, is compatible with most of the API
functionality of the Arduino LiquidCrystal library as well as
with most of the LCD API 1.0 Specification (some of which is nearly obsolete).

The hd44780 API also provides some addtional extensions and all the API
functions provided by hd44780 are common across all i/o subclasses.
The most most significant extensions being:
- ability to modify the libraries expected command execution times.
- API functions return a status to indicate whether successful
- ability to tell if lcd initialization failed
- ability to read data or status from the LCD (requires r/w control)
- ability to tell if sending a raw command to the LCD failed

S/W requirements
================
- ### IDE version 1.0 or later (versions 1.6.9 and higher are recommended)

- ### IDE versions that should be avoided:
	- IDE versions 1.5 to 1.55 (unnecessary file name restrictions, breaks many libraries)
	- IDE version 1.6.6 (has function prototyping issues that can break some sketches)
	- IDE version 1.6.8 (has serial port issues that breaks on certain boards)

**NOTE**<br>
There are two "Ardino" entities. arduino.cc and arduino.org
While things appear to be converging/merging, and on Dec 20, 2016 there was a big merging of the two code bases
for the 1.8.0 release, for the time being,
IDEs from arduino.org are still not recommended as arduino.org 1.8.0 is not the same as arduino.cc 1.8.0
and the 1.8.0 arduino.org IDE does not work at all in some OS environments.
Also, IDEs from Arduino.org  prior to 1.8.0 are quite far behind IDEs from arduino.cc interms of 
of features and have function prototyping issues that prevent some of the example sketches in
this library from compiling. 
Therefore, for the time being, it is recommend that Arduino IDEs be obtained from arduino.cc

H/W support
===========
Library should work on all Arduino boards including boards with AVR, pic32, arm, and ESP8266 processors.

**WARNING**<br>
Use caution when using 3v only processors like arm and ESP8266 processors when interfacing with 5v modules
as not doing proper level shifting or incorrectly hooking things up can damage the processor.

The library currenly comes with the following i/o subclasses:

* `hd44780_pinIO` control LCD using direct Arduino Pin connections

* `hd44780_I2Cexp` control LCD using i2c i/o exapander backpack (PCF8574 or MCP23008)

* `hd44780_I2Clcd` control LCD with native i2c interface (PCF2116, PCF2119x, etc...)

* `hd44780_NTCU165ECPB` control Noritake CU165ECBP-T2J LCD display over SPI


Installation
============
For generic information about Arduino libraries and how to isntall them consult the Arduino Libraries page:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

For ease of installation it is recommended to use an IDE that supports the library mananager which was implemented in IDE version 1.6.2

### Installation using Library manager (IDE 1.6.2 and later)
In the IDE, Simply click on [Sketch]->Include Library->Manage Libraries...<br>
Then search for "Extensible hd44780" to locate the library and install it.<br>
There is no need to uninstall or modify any other LCD libary that may have already been installed.

### Installation using zip file w/o library manager (IDE 1.6.1 and earlier)
Installation requires downloading a zip image and
then, depending on the version of the IDE you can either install it from the IDE or install it manually by unziping the file into your sketchbook libraries.

**NOTE**: due to the way github creates its zip files, there is a manual step that must be done to rename the library directory created in your sketchbook libraries area.

First, dowload a library zip image from the github repository releases area:<br>
https://github.com/duinoWitchery/hd44780/releases <br>
Download the image by clicking the zip icon for the desired release.

#### Installation of zip file library on IDE 1.0.6 to 1.6.1
The library can be installed from the zip image using the IDE.
Install it by clicking on:
[Sketch]->Include Library->Add .ZIP library...
then, simply select the hd44780.zip image you downloaded.

The hd44780 sketchbook library must now be renamed. (see below)

#### Installation of zip file library on IDE 1.0 to 1.0.5
On these versions of the IDE, the install must be done manually.
To install the library simply extract it into your sketchbook/libraries directory.
If you don't know where you sketchbook/libraries directory is simply click on:
[File]-Prefernces
or from the keyboard type: &lt;ctrl&gt;comma (hold ctrl and press comma)
The location of your sketchbook directory will be in the text box.
The zip image must be installed in a directory called "libraries" under that directory.<br>

After the zip file has been extracted and the hd44780 sketchbook library has been created,
the library must now be renamed. (see below)

### Renaming hd44780 libary directory name after installation w/o library manager
When not using the library manager, the hd44780 library directory created in your sketchbook libary area will not be the correct name.
This is due to the way github creates its zip files and the way the IDE library manager works.
The downloaded zip file and internal directory will have a name like hd44780-X.Y.Z which causes the sketchbook library name to also be hd44780-X.Y.Z
While the IDE will usually allow this to work, the proper name should be simply "hd44780" and not using its real name can cause issues in the future.<br>
To rename the library directory, simply go to the sketchbook library location and rename it.
If you don't know where you sketchbook/libraries directory is simply click on:
[File]-Prefernces
or from the keyboard type: &lt;ctrl&gt;comma (hold ctrl and press comma)
The location of your sketchbook directory will be in the text box.<br>
Use your favorite tool to rename it.
