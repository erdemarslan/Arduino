# Arduino Library for the Octasonic HC-SR04 Breakout Board

This is an arduino library for the Octasonic HC-SR04 breakout board that allow you to connect up to 8 HC-SR04 sensors to an Arduino with just a few wires.

## Connecting the board to an Arduino Uno

Connect the Octasonic pins to Arduino Uno pins as follows

```
Octasonic Arduino Uno
5V        5V
SCK       Digital 13
MISO      Digital 12
MOSI      Digital 11
SS        Digital 10
GND       GND
```

## Installing this library

There are lots of good tutorials on the internet about installing Arduino libraries so I suggest searching for those. Hoever, the short version is that recent versions of the Arduino IDE have a menu option for installing libraries and that is the easiest approach. Simply download a zip of this repository (there is a 'Download ZIP' button near the top right of this page) and then import that into the IDE.
